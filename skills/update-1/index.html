        <h2>Skills Update 1: 2/23/18</h2>
        <p>This week, I introduced myself to Adobe Audition. After a quick review of Audacity, which took way less time than I had anticipated, I had success in learning the basics of Audition. By the end, I was able to adequately recreate my standard vocal effects chain on a voice sample.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I think I may have set my sights too narrow for this skills assignment. I learned how to manipulate vocals in just about every way I know how to. I believe I have the skills in Audition to create a podcast, clean up voice in a video, or even edit vocals for a song in a pinch. I will look through the rest of my materials, but I might have to adjust course and learn some music-making techniques, or perhaps become more proficient in Ableton.</p>
