        <h2>Craigslist For Sale Ad Parody</h2>
        <p><b>PRICE: $99-$999</b></p>
        <p>Now selling seven used and decorated MacBooks, priced to sell! Makes and models are unknown, so expert buyers are encouraged. If interested, meet me near my van parked by the local library. I only accept cash, but I will barter for the right offer. If you wish to contact me, please message me on my AOL instant messenger account Xx_tech_bargains_xX. I will not sell to cops, so don’t bother writing me if you’re a cop, because I’ll know.</p>
        <p><b>UPDATE:</b> Yesterday I received a complaint that my MacBooks are illegitimately for sale. I want to assure you that I offer a variety of legitimate tech products, including a new iPhone 7 with a bright orange Denver Broncos case and a Subway gift card of indeterminate amount. AIM me if interested.</p>
